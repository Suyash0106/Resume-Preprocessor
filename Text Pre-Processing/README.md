# Text Pre-processing

Extract the data file from the "Data.zip" and place the data file at the same location as the "Text Pre-Processing.ipynb" file. Execute
each cell in the python notebook sequentially. This file uses regular expressions for finding all the possible identifiers and creates a
new preprocessed file "29279208_preprocessedData.txt" that stores the unique identifier of keys and its values.

This program reads data from a text document which contains resumes of about 30,000 candidates. This data is extracted and structured 
into XML and JSON format. The documents containing the formatted output are stored in "29279208_output.xml" and "29279208_output.json" 
files respectively.

Please note that the preprocessed file and the output files are not included in this repository because of their large size. However, 
the code automatically creates these files.
